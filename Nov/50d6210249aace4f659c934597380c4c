The Global Shea Alliance seeks to double production of the oily nut in West Africa as it invests $13 million to assist growers and expand markets. The alliance is targeting shea output of 1.2 million metric tons by 2021 in a venture with the U.S. Agency for International Development, Moumouni Konate, president of the lobby, said in an interview in Tamale, about 630 kilometers (391 miles) north of Ghana’s capital, Accra. Shea, used as a cooking oil and cosmetic ingredient, is grown and collected by small-scale farmers in the region in countries including Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Benin. “We want to expand Shea utilization in food and cosmetic markets” as the venture seeks to plant 500,000 new trees and build warehouses, Konate said.
